one-button-drawing is an experimental, browser-based tool for rapidly sketching
architectural floor plans on an infinite canvas. You describe design rules in plain
English (e.g. minimum wall thickness) and lay out rooms whose relationships are driven
by an editable adjacency matrix; the app parses those constraints — via the Anthropic
LLM with a deterministic regex fallback — flags violations, and renders the resulting
partitions and facades. Sign-in (optional, via Firebase) persists your constraints and
matrix per account, while Guest mode runs everything locally without saving.
